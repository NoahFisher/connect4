Take-home coding project: B
Implement the following multi-player game of Connect 4

Game rules
  Users connect to a web service and are anonymously matched with one other user
  Board is 7x6
  Players take turns dropping a token into one of the columns
  If a player connects 4 in any direction, they win
  If the board fills up, the game is a tie

Requirements
  Users must be able to play without an account
  Games must be stored forever
  Players within a single game must not be able to submit moves for each other
  The game interface must display the current board state with the players' tokens
  The server must support 10,000 daily users for at least 1 year while costs less than 50/mo to host

Document your implementation

Optional bonus features
  Allow players in a game to exchange messages 😃
  Add the ability to spectate games 👏
  Realistically animate tiles falling through the board 🏆
